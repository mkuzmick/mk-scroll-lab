And the just man trailed God\'s shining agent, \n \
over a black mountain, in his giant track, \n \
while a restless voice kept harrying his woman: \n \
"It\'s not too late, you can still look back \n \
at the red towers of your native Sodom, \n \
the square where once you sang, the spinning-shed, \n \
at the empty windows set in the tall house \n \
where sons and daughters blessed your marriage-bed. \n \
A single glance: a sudden dart of pain \n \
stitching her eyes before she made a sound . . \n \
Her body flaked into transparent salt, \n \
and her swift legs rooted to the ground. \n \
Who will grieve for this woman? Does she not seem \n \
too insignificant for our concern? \n \
Yet in my heart I never will deny her, \n \
who suffered death because she chose to turn.'
